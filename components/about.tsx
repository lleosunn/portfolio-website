        As a freshman at MIT, I am currently completing my General Institute Requirements,
        allowing me to focus on my academic interests in the coming years. I am passionate
        about robotics and eager to gain more exposure and experience in the field.
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a pole vaulter on the MIT Track and Field team,
        with a personal record of 15â€™. I am also actively involved in campus life as a member of
        Phi Delta Theta, the Chinese Students Club, and the Asian American Association.

        Outside of school, I enjoy exploring new places, eating good food, and spending time with my amazing loving girlfriend.
